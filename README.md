# Simple Automation Using GitHub Actions

A simple demo showing how to automate data extraction from an API, transform it using Python, and load it into a MySQL database ‚Äî all orchestrated with GitHub Actions.

---

## üß© Business Problem

A new request came from the sales department requiring a table to house specific logic and receive daily updates. Given the company‚Äôs current process, manually downloading data from the app, transforming it using Python, and uploading it into the database ‚Äî this was not scalable and would add to an already heavy workload.

## ‚úÖ The Solution

Automate the workflow using:

- **API access** to replace manual downloads
- **Python script** to handle transformation and database loading
- **GitHub Actions** to run the pipeline daily without manual effort

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Taken

### 1. API Integration  
Requested access to the API endpoints for the required dataset. This step was key ‚Äî APIs make automation possible.

### 2. Python Script  
Wrote a Python script that:

- Pulls JSON data from the API
- Flattens and cleans the data
- Transforms it (e.g., creates new columns or filters rows)
- Loads the final table into a MySQL database

### 3. GitHub Automation  
Created a GitHub repository and added:

- The Python script
- A `requirements.txt` file to specify dependencies
- A `.github/workflows/main.yml` file containing the GitHub Actions workflow

## ü§ñ Automation with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions allows automation directly from your repo. With a workflow file, you can run your Python script on a schedule (e.g., daily at midnight).

### Basic GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Run ETL Script

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # every day at 00:00 UTC
  workflow_dispatch:      # allows manual trigger

jobs:
  etl-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run ETL script
      run: python etl.py
